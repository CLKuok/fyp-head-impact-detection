### Step 1: Create a GitHub Account (if you don't have one)
1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com).
2. Sign up for a new account or log in if you already have one.

### Step 2: Create a New Repository
1. Once logged in, click on the "+" icon in the upper right corner and select "New repository."
2. Fill in the repository details:
   - **Repository Name**: `impact-detection-player-tracking`
   - **Description**: A Jupyter notebook for impact detection and player tracking in football videos.
   - **Public/Private**: Choose "Public" if you want others to see it.
   - **Initialize this repository with a README**: Check this option if you want to add a README file.
3. Click on the "Create repository" button.

### Step 3: Upload Your Jupyter Notebook
1. In your new repository, click on the "Add file" button and select "Upload files."
2. Drag and drop your Jupyter notebook file (`impact_detection_tracker.ipynb`) into the upload area or click "choose your files" to select it from your computer.
3. Optionally, you can add a commit message (e.g., "Add impact detection and player tracking notebook").
4. Click on the "Commit changes" button.

### Step 4: Add Additional Documentation
1. You may want to edit the README file to provide more details about your project, including:
   - How to set up the environment.
   - Required libraries and dependencies.
   - Instructions on how to run the notebook.
   - Any other relevant information.

### Step 5: Share Your Repository
1. Once your notebook is uploaded and the README is updated, you can share the link to your repository with others.
2. The URL will be in the format: `https://github.com/yourusername/impact-detection-player-tracking`.

### Optional: Add a License
1. If you want to allow others to use your code, consider adding a license. You can do this by clicking on "Add file" and selecting "Create new file."
2. Name the file `LICENSE` and choose a license type (e.g., MIT License).

### Conclusion
You now have a GitHub repository for your Jupyter notebook on impact detection and player tracking. Others can clone or download your repository to replicate your work.
